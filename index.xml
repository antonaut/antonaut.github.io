      <description>This started out as a blog for written answers to assignments from a course in Computer Game Design&amp;nbsp;1 at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. Its purpose is to serve as a diary of sorts. It is a place where I jot down ideas, thoughts and reflections about my life and computers.
It is solemnly written by me, Anton Erholt. I am 28 years old and live in Stockholm, Sweden.</description>

      <title>How to set up SSH with key-based authentication</title>
      <link>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/how-to-set-up-ssh-with-key-based-authentication/</link>

      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/how-to-set-up-ssh-with-key-based-authentication/</guid>
      <description>SSH is a service used to connect remotely from one machine to another. It is used on pretty much all operating systems except Windows.
In this example, I use two machines. The workstation is the machine we are connecting from and the server is the machine we are connecting to.
First off, make sure SSH (ssh, ssh-keygen) is installed. Since I use Arch Linux it&amp;rsquo;s already there by default. A quick search yields this site with instructions for Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>This piece finds okay positions where a single queen can&amp;rsquo;t take the piece (on a 8x8 chess board). It took a little while to write, but I think it reads pretty well and is done in a functional style. I was TOO SLOW to finish this in a single clash! (1h 10min)
Learned about generation with lazy-seq and map-indexed together with list comprehension (for).

      <description>Over at CodinGame they have something called clashes of code where you compete with other developers to solve a certain problem in a given amount of time. I know there are quite a few sites where you can sharpen your coding skills, but somehow I got stuck at this one. Maybe it provides me with just enough challenge for me with my current skills.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use the clashes to learn more about Clojure.</description>

      <title>End of my game dev story?</title>

      <description>We worked on this for a while, but it just ran out in the sand when I went to France for exchange studies. Nevertheless, it was a great learning experience for me. I think I mostly learned a bunch of javascript. We built the client side of a somewhat advanced game. The coolest part was a small window system built mostly by my friends in WebGL.
Hopefully we can publish the code with some small examples.</description>

      <description>The idea of a tool giving you access to finding relevant papers in a certain field of research is pretty interesting. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine all the papers as a planar graph depicted on a sphere. The edges (arrows/links) of the graphs are keywords or subjects. A certain &amp;lsquo;theme&amp;rsquo; (a set of papers) would then be a &amp;lsquo;continent&amp;rsquo; on the sphere.

      <description>A master&amp;rsquo;s thesis is an intense 18 weeks of total focus and devotion to a research question. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve only been able to invest about one weeks worth of studies during a four week period. My personal life is taking its toll on my work at the moment. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s that frustrating, but I&amp;rsquo;d really like to get more stuff done.
In order to increase my productivity I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a plan.</description>

      <description>I read this article about idea debt. Not sure which affected me the most. What she stated about idea investment, or the fact that she too doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to use the french subjunctive correctly. Nonetheless, I&amp;rsquo;m truly inspired to put my old ideas to the side and work with what I&amp;rsquo;ve got at the moment. I want to start documenting stuff properly. This is my blog.

      <title>Regarding problems which can be solved by dynamic programming techniques</title>

      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/regarding-problems-which-can-be-solved-by-dynamic-programming-techniques/</guid>
      <description>I have recently watched quite a few videos on dynamic programming. What is dynamic programming? It&amp;rsquo;s a method for constructing efficient solutions to some specific problems. In order to apply the method, there are some criteria needed to be met.
 The problem should have a brute-force solution/exhaustive search solution. The problem should be dividable into sub-problems with optimal solutions (explained further down) The problem should have a recursive definition.  NOTE: I&amp;rsquo;m not doing this in a formal manner, I simply think out loud in order to understand the subject better.</description>

      <title>A flawed idea of the halting problem</title>
      <link>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/a-flawed-idea-of-the-halting-problem/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/a-flawed-idea-of-the-halting-problem/</guid>
      <description>The halting problem is fairly interesting even though someone (Alan Turing) some time ago (1936) has proved that it can not be solved by a general algorithm. It is undecidable. Despite the fact, today when I woke up I had an idea.
Let us use a FSM to describe the program. Think of it as a FSM with A LOT OF STATES. Almost as if it is an Infinite State Machine (which would not be of much use), but rather a very large FSM.</description>

      <description>A lot has happened since we started developing the game. Our initial goal was to do these tasks during the hackathon:
 WebSockets and API TouchEvents GameLoop and GameStates  Afterwards, we now have a somewhat working APICallSystem with Secure WebSockets. Unfortunately havn&amp;rsquo;t our exportation framework for Android and iOS supported the wss protocol yet, but it&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be up and running soon. During the hackathon I had a great time.</description>

      <title>To use DDD or not (| !) to use DDD</title>
      <link>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/to-use-ddd-or-not---to-use-ddd/</link>

      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/to-use-ddd-or-not---to-use-ddd/</guid>
      <description>My initial thoughts on Data Driven Development was that it to some extent might have been unneccessary (mainly due to the fact that I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it fully). I thought that when making a smaller game, you probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t benefit from using a DDD code style at all. However, after reading this post on why one should use an entity-component-system composition of a game/gameengine, I have changed my mind.
Our initial approach to writing the game was with OOP (Object-Oriented Principles) which gave us a massive Character class, which as of right now only seems unneccessary.</description>

      <description>About a year ago, me and two classmates (johntu &amp;amp; dmol) participated in a programming competition called Escape from /dev/null. The competition is based around having to program something that assembles a client to a web-based API revolving different things. The API gets further uncovered as you get further into the competition. It&amp;rsquo;s a game in a game. Very meta and Oh-So-Lovely&amp;trade; if you are into these kinds of things.</description>

      <description>When playing a game on a mobile device, you have very little time to make the player interested. This is a very similar problem to the one where websites have only a few seconds to present the right content to the visitor or else the visitor will browse away from the site. These problems are hard to solve (their respective decision problems are probably way more than NP-complete [Comp. Sci. humor] ).</description>

Pay-to-play (P2P) The &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; model. You pay for a game once and then it is yours. For all eternity&amp;#x2026; Oh, you want an example? Hmm&amp;#x2026; Let&amp;rsquo;s see. Oh! Project Zomboid&amp;nbsp;1 mentioned in an earlier post is a good example.

      <description>Today we had a guest lecture from Per Str√∂mb√§ck of Dataspelsbranchen, the trade organization for Swedish game development. He wanted us to discuss two specific questions which all in all are quite important when it comes.
How can the game developer interact with the audience?
There are multiple ways of interacting with your target audience as a game dev. The easiest to come up with are probably through public forums, a wiki, social media and/or some other kind of web based communcation.</description>

      <description>Some games are really nothing but great combination of physics, animation and astonishing scenery. One example I would like to discuss is a game called flower (note, no capital f)&amp;nbsp;1. In flower one controls a single petal flying in the wind over an enormous field. As you fly across the field, if you hit other flowers, some of its petals will join you in your flight. In order to complete a level you need to collect a certain number of petals and reach the end (although I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is specified how many you need).</description>

      <description>This post will be filled with spontaneous questions and answers related to whether one should use an existing game engine or create one from scratch.
What budget are you on? If I&amp;rsquo;m really low on a budget I&amp;rsquo;ll probably use an engine if it can save me some time we all know; Time is money. The time saving aspect is also present when it comes to maintaining the game and/or improving it.</description>

      <title>Future of procedural generation of content</title>

      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/future-of-procedural-generation-of-content/</guid>
      <description>I really think that map generation or procedural content generation is something which is becoming more and more common in games. Instead of playing linear, story based games we get to experience multidimensional games where we create our own unique worlds (or have our own worlds created for us). However, generating good maps is a really difficult problem which really hasn&amp;rsquo;t been available until more recently so I think that there are many improvements to be made here in the future.</description>

      <guid>http://ctrlaltdelete.nu/blog/data-driven-approach/</guid>
      <description>A data-driven approach is shifted from Object Oriented approaches. The data-driven approach seems like a really good fit if you are geared towards making a state-of-the art game engine for making really high performing games. Bitsquid is certainly outstanding in that sense
It&amp;rsquo;s always a bit tricky when you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new programming paradigm. Usually you learn a new programming language together with the paradigm which can help you understand difficult patterns and ideas more easily.</description>

      <description>I think the model used to develop a game is really depending on what type of game you make. I&amp;rsquo;d like to address the fact that not every type of game needs to be high-end performing. As a guideline though, whatever type of development model which allows you to be productive is useful.
Do you have a ton of ideas which needs to be tested before you can decide upon stuff?</description>

      <description>Today I played a game by originally made by Seatribe called Haven and Hearth&amp;nbsp;1. It&amp;rsquo;s a MMORPG where death, Permanent death(!), is imminent. The scenario takes place in a world quite similar to real nature. There are no fictive elements in the game in that sense. It&amp;rsquo;s really like a simulation of a subset of the real world. Typically you travel around in a forest of some sorts. There are mountains, rivers and lakes for you to explore.</description>

      <description>My name&amp;rsquo;s Anton Erholt and I&amp;rsquo;ve just started my master&amp;rsquo;s programme in Computer Science at KTH. I&amp;rsquo;m 23 years old and live in a suburb of Stockholm together with two of my friends.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing computer games for about as long as I can remember. I remember the Christmas when I got my first console, the Nintendo Game Boy&amp;nbsp;1 together with Super Mario Land&amp;nbsp;2.
Ever since then, I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve been kind of hooked on handheld games.</description>
