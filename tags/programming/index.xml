      <description>The halting problem is fairly interesting even though someone (Alan Turing) some time ago (1936) has proved that it can not be solved by a general algorithm. It is undecidable. Despite the fact, today when I woke up I had an idea.
Let us use a FSM to describe the program. Think of it as a FSM with A LOT OF STATES. Almost as if it is an Infinite State Machine (which would not be of much use), but rather a very large FSM.</description>
