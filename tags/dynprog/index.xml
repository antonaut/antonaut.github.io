      <description>I have recently watched quite a few videos on dynamic programming. What is dynamic programming? It&amp;rsquo;s a method for constructing efficient solutions to some specific problems. In order to apply the method, there are some criteria needed to be met.
 The problem should have a brute-force solution/exhaustive search solution. The problem should be dividable into sub-problems with optimal solutions (explained further down) The problem should have a recursive definition.  NOTE: I&amp;rsquo;m not doing this in a formal manner, I simply think out loud in order to understand the subject better.</description>
